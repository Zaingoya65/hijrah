      <h3 className={styles.heading}> IMpact of Al-Hijrah on the Community</h3>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        At the core of Al-Hijrah’s impact is its commitment to providing quality
        education. The school offers a well-rounded curriculum that balances
        academic rigor with character development. By equipping students with
        essential knowledge and skills, Al-Hijrah empowers them to pursue higher
        education and professional careers. This educational foundation helps
        bridge the gap between students from rural backgrounds and those from
        more developed areas, fostering a more equitable society.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Al-Hijrah’s educational philosophy extends beyond intellectual growth.
        The institution emphasizes character building and moral development,
        rooted in Islamic teachings. Students are encouraged to uphold values
        such as integrity, compassion, and respect. This holistic approach
        ensures that graduates are not only knowledgeable but also ethically
        grounded. As these young individuals grow into responsible adults, they
        carry forward these values into their personal and professional lives,
        positively influencing their communities.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        One of the most significant impacts of Al-Hijrah is its role in
        empowering the youth of Ziarat. Many students come from humble
        backgrounds, and the opportunities provided by the school often
        represent a chance to break the cycle of poverty. Through scholarships
        and financial aid, Al-Hijrah ensures that deserving students have access
        to quality education regardless of their economic situation. This
        empowerment enables them to contribute meaningfully to their communities
        and become agents of positive change.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Al-Hijrah’s influence extends to community development through various
        initiatives. The school often engages in outreach programs and community
        service projects, fostering a spirit of volunteerism among students.
        These activities not only benefit local communities but also instill a
        sense of social responsibility in students. By participating in such
        programs, students learn the importance of giving back and develop a
        deeper connection with their community.
